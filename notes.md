# Component creation steps

To build our new components, we should follow the same steps as before.

- Create a file with our component name
- Create & Export the component function
- Add the base HTML in the return statement of our component
- Create & Import a CSS / SCSS file holding the style of our component
- Write stories for Storybook to render our component in isolation
- Refactor the hardcoded content to use props & state

- Those are the steps that we used to build our <Button>, <DayListItem> and <DayList> components.
